### Motivation

This is a senior design project for CS179J (Computer Architecture and Embedded Systems) Summer 2021 at the University 
of California, Riverside.

The __Smart Water Station__ recommends and tracks the _daily hydration_ of a number of people, it also dispenses water! It 
does this through the use of three main subsystems:
- Graphical User Interface (GUI)
- RFID Sensor and Cards
- Water Pump / Dispenser
